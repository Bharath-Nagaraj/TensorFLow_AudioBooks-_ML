# TensorFLow_AudioBooks-_ML
You are given data from an Audiobook app. 
Logically, it relates only to the audio versions of books. Each customer in the database has made a purchase at least once, that's why he/she is in the database.
We want to create a machine learning algorithm based on our available data that can predict if a customer will buy again from the Audiobook company.
